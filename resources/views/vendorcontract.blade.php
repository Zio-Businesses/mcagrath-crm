Changes to the scope of Services under the SOW shall not be effective unless and until agreed upon in writing by the Parties, including, without limitation, pursuant to an approved bid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) any services approved by <strong>MCGRATH CONSULTING</strong> and for work performed by or delivered by Sub-Contractor (including any of its subcontractors), whether reflected in the SOW or otherwise, shall be governed by, and subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement and (b) any bid or other written agreement that reflects Services to be performed or work to be delivered and is approved by the Parties, shall be incorporated by reference into, and governed by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

As a service company we have to warranty to our clients one year, we changed it for you for 90 days.

 

3      COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS:

      VI.         CONFIDENTIALITY:

This provision will continue to be effective after the termination of this Contract, and if Confidentiality is NOT adhered to, Contractor shall effectively be harmed and may hold Vendor responsible for up to 10 times the total contract amount of which shall be agreed in advance for injury or breach by the vendor.

All inspection and certification will be done at Vendor's expense in connection with the SOW. Should Contractor have to perform inspections to certify vendors work, Vendor shall be responsible for all costs and fees Contractor shall have to cover to certify work by Vendor so that it may bill its Client at required times. DEFAULT. The occurrence of any of the following shall constitute a material default under this Contract: A.) The failure of <strong>MCGRATH CONSULTING</strong> to make a required payment when due. B.) The insolvency of either party or if either party shall, either voluntarily or involuntarily, become a debtor of or seek protection under Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. C.)

This notice shall describe with sufficient detail the nature of the default. The party receiving said notice shall have 1 days from the effective date of said notice to cure the default(s) or finalize immediately substantial completion, if completion cannot be made in 2 days. Unless waived by a party providing notice, the failure to cure or begin curing, the default(s) within such time period shall result in the automatic termination of this Contract. Any monies owed back to Contractor by Vendor if work was not completed accordingly shall be paid back immediately, and any monies owed to Vendor by Quantum meruit, Vendor shall be paid immediately for all completed work according to the schedule of values assigned in the SOW. If Contractor is in breach, Vendor shall have all rights to collect and if not paid within 60 days, shall have the right to lien the property unless Contractor shall pay for and assign a payment bond to satisfy the total cost of work should litigation be required. If Vendor is in breach or has committed fraud by any nature of inspection, warranty, or workmanship, then Contractor shall have limits of remuneration of up to 10 times the value of the total contract plus any Anticipatory breach, Minor or partial breach, Material or total breach and such Liquidated damages shall be binding on both parties and any Punitive damages which shall be allowed in a court of law.

 

     X.         ENTIRE AGREEMENT:

This Contract contains the entire Agreement of the parties, and there are no other promises or conditions in any other contract or agreement whether oral or written concerning the subject matter of this Agreement. Any amendments must be in writing and signed by each party. This Agreement supersedes any prior written or oral agreements between the parties.

 

     XI.         SEVERABILITY:

If any provision of this Agreement will be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions will continue to be valid and enforceable. If a court finds that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision will be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced as so limited.

 

     XII.         GOVERNING LAW:

This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the laws of the State of New Jersey, without regard to any choice of law provisions of or any other jurisdiction.

    XIV.         WAIVER OF CONTRACTUAL RIGHT:
